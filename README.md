====================
This is an automatic code generator of Get and Set functions for go structs.

You need to install the go_get_set_generator. To get the latest released version use:

```GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/Jille/go_get_set_generator@latest```

Running go_get_set_generator
----------------------------
```get_set_generate -source=path/fileName.go```

this will generate a new file with name `fileName_getter_setter.go` containing all the 
get set functions for the structs present in the specified file.
